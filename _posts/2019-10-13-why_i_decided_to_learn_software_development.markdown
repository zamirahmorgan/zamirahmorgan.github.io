I've always loved using computers since I was a kid and my parents work in the technical field of their respective industries. I guess you can say that it where most of my influence and inspiration came from, but I didn't officially know I wanted to learn about software development until after I graduated college. I originally studied computer graphics which is a combination of computer art, animation, and web development, etc. After graduating from college, I ended up working as a User Experience/ User Interface Designer and Developer because I liked to do both design and web development together seeing as they were both useful skills to have. 

Once I started working with the other software engineers and communicated with them on how the website should function based on the users feedback or needs, I slowly began to teach myself coding in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I also took a few computer courses that focused more on coding because I saw that I could turn my designs into a live interaction. Since I've always felt that Disney magic in making creations come to life, that is how I view the world of people who use computers. I decided to learn more so that I could not only be technically good at what I do, but to also use it as a point of creativity and seeing users use what I built online puts a smile on my face. This is because I can see them using it for a need of help, purpose, and personal enjoyment. 

Now that I've been introduced to other languages and seeing that I have more to learn without ever being bored of doing the same routine for years, I can't wait to improve my logical skills in coding, and creating something more complex than just websites alone.
